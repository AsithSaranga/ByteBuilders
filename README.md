# ByteBuilders
ByteBuilders is a team dedicated to transforming the operations of TechRepair, an electronic parts repair shop, through a sophisticated Java Swing application. Our project aims to automate and optimize various business processes to enhance efficiency and productivity for TechRepair. The key features of our solution include:

1. Customer Order Management: Streamlining the process of adding, updating, and removing customer orders for repairs, maintenance, and spare parts. The system ensures that parts required for specific orders are automatically sourced from suppliers.

2. Supplier Management: Efficiently managing relationships with multiple suppliers worldwide. This includes maintaining up-to-date contact information, tracking parts sourced from each supplier, and ensuring seamless integration with the inventory system.

3. Inventory Management: Automating inventory tracking to monitor the stock of spare parts in real-time. The system predicts when stock will run low and automatically generates orders to replenish supplies, ensuring that the shop is always well-stocked.

4. Employee Management: Keeping detailed records of employee information, job roles, and schedules. Our system allocates employees to customer jobs based on their skills and availability, ensuring optimal workforce utilization.

5. Job Allocation: Scheduling employees for various jobs, taking into account their specific skills and roles. The system can handle complex job requirements that may involve multiple employees with different expertise.

6. Monthly Report Generation: Creating detailed monthly reports on the sales of spare parts and services. These reports provide valuable insights into sales trends, top-selling items, and areas where improvements can be made.

7. Automated Notifications: Sending automatic notifications to customers when their devices are ready for collection, and to employees when they are assigned new jobs. This feature ensures timely communication and enhances customer satisfaction and employee efficiency.

Our project not only streamlines TechRepair's operations but also leverages automation to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and improve overall business performance. With ByteBuilders' solution, TechRepair is set to achieve higher levels of operational excellence and customer satisfaction.
